    <h2>How the application and indexing works?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The content from <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming" target="_blank">Java Programming</a> has been indexed and scarped in Python and pushed to Elasticsearch engine which is hosted in AWS server</li>
        <li>Elasticsearch is an open-source search engine built on top of Apache Luceneâ„¢, a full-text search-engine library</li>
        <li>From the java programming home page, 93 additional links was found and contents from those webpage are scraped (nearly 600) and pushed to elastic search where these data are indexed and searchable</li>
        <li>When a post is clicked in the web application, the content of the post is sent to server, where server removes set of words called stopwords. Stop words are commonly eliminated from many text processing applications because these words can be distracting, non-informative (or non-discriminative) and are additional memory overhead</li>
        <li>The resulting text after removed of the stopwords are sent to Elasticsearch engine, where it searches its datastore and matches top posts matching the received content</li>
        <li>Then top 10 matching content are sent back to the server and then displayed in the web application</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>List of Questions and Answers</h2>

        <li id="1" onclick="getRecommendations(event)" class="list-group-item">I was presented with this question in an end of module open book exam today and found myself lost. i was reading Head first Javaand both definitions seemed to be exactly the same. i was just wondering what the MAIN difference was for my own piece of mind. i know there are a number of similar questions to this but, none i have seen which provide a definitive answer.Thanks, Darren</li>
        <li id="2" onclick="getRecommendations(event)" class="list-group-item">Inheritance is when a 'class' derives from an existing 'class'.So if you have a Person class, then you have a Student class that extends Person, Student inherits all the things that Person has.There are some details around the access modifiers you put on the fields/methods in Person, but that's the basic idea.For example, if you have a private field on Person, Student won't see it because its private, and private fields are not visible to subclasses.Polymorphism deals with how the program decides which methods it should use, depending on what type of thing it has.If you have a Person, which has a read method, and you have a Student which extends Person, which has its own implementation of read, which method gets called is determined for you by the runtime, depending if you have a Person or a Student.It gets a bit tricky, but if you do something likePerson p = new Student();p.read();the read method on Student gets called.Thats the polymorphism in action.You can do that assignment because a Student is a Person, but the runtime is smart enough to know that the actual type of p is Student.Note that details differ among languages.You can do inheritance in javascript for example, but its completely different than the way it works in Java.</li>
        <li id="3" onclick="getRecommendations(event)" class="list-group-item">Polymorphism: The ability to treat objects of different types in a similar manner.Example: Giraffe and Crocodile are both Animals, and animals can Move.If you have an instance of an Animal then you can call Move without knowing or caring what type of animal it is.Inheritance: This is one way of achieving both Polymorphism and code reuse at the same time.Other forms of polymorphism:There are other way of achieving polymorphism, such as interfaces, which provide only polymorphism but no code reuse (sometimes the code is quite different, such as Move for a Snake would be quite different from Move for a Dog, in which case an Interface would be the better polymorphic choice in this case.In other dynamic languages polymorphism can be achieved with Duck Typing, which is the classes don't even need to share the same base class or interface, they just need a method with the same name.Or even more dynamic like Javascript, you don't even need classes at all, just an object with the same method name can be used polymorphically.</li>
        <li id="4" onclick="getRecommendations(event)" class="list-group-item">I found out that the above piece of code is perfectly legal in Java. I have the following questions. ThanksAdded one more question regarding Abstract method classes.</li>
        <li id="5" onclick="getRecommendations(event)" class="list-group-item">In java it's a bit difficult to implement a deep object copy function. What steps you take to ensure the original object and the cloned one share no reference?</li>
        <li id="6" onclick="getRecommendations(event)" class="list-group-item">You can make a deep copy serialization without creating some files. Copy: Restore:</li>
        <li id="7" onclick="getRecommendations(event)" class="list-group-item">Java has the ability to create classes at runtime. These classes are known as Synthetic Classes or Dynamic Proxies. See for more information. Other open-source libraries, such as and also allow you to generate synthetic classes, and are more powerful than the libraries provided with the JRE. Synthetic classes are used by AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) libraries such as Spring AOP and AspectJ, as well as ORM libraries such as Hibernate.</li>
        <li id="8" onclick="getRecommendations(event)" class="list-group-item">A safe way is to serialize the object, then deserialize.This ensures everything is a brand new reference.about how to do this efficiently. Caveats: It's possible for classes to override serialization such that new instances are created, e.g. for singletons.Also this of course doesn't work if your classes aren't Serializable.</li>
